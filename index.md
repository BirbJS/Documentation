# Birb.JS Discord Bot Framework

Hey there, welcome to Birb!

Birb is a simple Discord Bot framework for Node, coded in TypeScript. It's designed from the ground up, whilst keeping vaugely close to the Discord.JS API. If you're familiar with Discord.JS, you'll feel right at home with Birb, with a few differences of course.

> **Note:** Birb is still in VERY early days. Use [Discord.JS](https://discord.js.org) for now, and check back later for updates!

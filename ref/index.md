# Reference
Hey there, and welcome to the Birb.JS API reference! Here, we list all properties, methods, classes and enums that you can use in your code, and also provide some information on what they do.

**This part of the Birb.JS documentation expects you to be familiar with JavaScript or TypeScript.** We encourage active learning, but we recommend you look into the basics of the coding languages we support first before jumping into the deep end.
